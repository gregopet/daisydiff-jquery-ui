# Daisy Diff jQuery UI #

This is a rewrite of the [Daisy Diff](http://code.google.com/p/daisydiff/) 1.2 user interface using jQuery UI. It requires no changes on the server side (other then adding two new libraries to the output HTML) as it provides shims for the HTML inlined function calls generated by Daisy Diff. A demo is available [here](http://freeweb.siol.net/akrasko1/daisydiff-jquery-ui/demo.html).

## Reasons for a rewrite ##

The original code has several issues: 

* uses obscure and seemingly obsolete libraries
* doesn't follow the [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) principle
* needs hardcoded setup of the images path in multiple separate locations
* cannot easily add mouseover events for showing diffs
* doesn't use a library to abstract browser-specific tasks or DOM manipulation
* the inline comments could be better

## Future plans ##

While my main reason for needing a rewrite was to add certain features for a proprietary app, there are certainly global improvements one could think of. One would be to generate an index of changes for easier navigation. If anyone has use for this project, I would be happy to accept feature suggestions!

Improvements added so far:

* configurable setting to display diff dialogs on mouse over as well
* Firefox now copies the diff background colors as well

## Technologies used ##

This rewrite uses the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery UI] (http://jqueryui.com/) libraries for the user interface. They bring in an API familiar to most javascript developers with solid documentation, theming and even plugin support, should it ever be needed.

The source is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).
